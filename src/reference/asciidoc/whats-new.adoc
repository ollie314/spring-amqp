=== What's New

==== Changes in 2.0 Since 1.6

===== Log4j Appender

This appender is no longer available due to the end-of-life of log4j.
See <<logging>> for information about the available log appenders.


===== RabbitTemplate Changes

IMPORTANT: Previously, a non-transactional `RabbitTemplate` participated in an existing transaction if it ran on a transactional listener container thread.
This was a serious bug; however, users might have relied on this behavior.
Starting with _version 1.6.2_, you must set the `channelTransacted` boolean on the template for it to participate in the container transaction.

The `AsyncRabbitTemplate` now supports Direct reply-to; see <<async-template>> for more information.

===== Listener Adapter

A convenient `FunctionalInterface` is available for using lambdas with the `MessageListenerAdapter`.
See <<message-listener-adapter>> for more information.

===== Listener Container Changes

Previously, `MessageProperties.getMessageCount()` returned `0` for messages emitted by the container.
This property only applies when using `basicGet` (e.g. from `RabbitTemplate.receive()` methods) and is now initialized to `null` for container messages.

===== Connection Factory Changes

The connection and channel listener interfaces now provide a mechanism to obtain information about exceptions.
See <<connection-channel-listeners>> and <<publishing-is-async>> for more information.

A new `ConnectionNameStrategy` is now provided to populate the application-specific identification of the target RabbitMQ connection from the `AbstractConnectionFactory`.
See <<connections>> for more information.

===== Retry Changes

The `MissingMessageIdAdvice` is no longer provided; it's functionality is now built-in; see <<retry>> for more information.

===== Anonymous Queue Naming

By default, `AnonymousQueues` are now named with the default `Base64UrlNamingStrategy` instead of a simple `UUID` string.
See <<anonymous-queue>> for more information.

==== Earlier Releases

See <<previous-whats-new>> for changes in previous versions.
